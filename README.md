================================================================================
This above assignment is a Dos-attack implementation using JavaScript. 
This code sends an Ajax request to the target application/site and brings
the server down so that it could not give any service at all by sending a 
lot of request to specified url. This is one type of attack(hacking) that is done by 
sending not malicious but just a bunch of requests to bring a server.
